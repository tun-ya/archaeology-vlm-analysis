It has pointed ears, a snout with bared teeth, and painted markings that resemble whiskers and stripes. The headdress covers most of the human head underneath.\n\nThe human face is painted orange with black details including large, almond-shaped eyes, a wide nose, a small mouth, and lines that might represent facial paint or scarification. The overall style is somewhat naive or folk-art-like.
