    "pred_answer": "The image shows a small, dark gray stone carving of a figure, possibly a deity or spirit. The carving is roughly rectangular and seems to be attached to a slightly larger, similarly shaped piece of stone that serves as a backing.  The figure itself has a pointed head, and what appear to be simplified facial features, possibly including eyes and a nose or mouth. Its body is less defined, seeming to taper downwards. The texture of the stone appears rough and pitted. A scale bar with the number 12677 is positioned below the artifact. The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige surface.",
    "answer": "Silver, repoussed into a butterfly, stamped, with four silver wires attached to appliqued silver balls and one small, oval, bezel-set turquoise stone.",
    "question": "Describe this image"

    "question": "Describe this image",
    "output": "Rating: 2\n\nExplanation: The generated response and the ground truth describe completely different objects. The generated response talks about a \"small, dark gray stone carving of a figure, possibly a deity or spirit,\" while the ground truth describes a \"silver, repoussed into a butterfly, stamped, with silver wires\" and a \"bezel-set turquoise stone.\" The only vague similarity might be the mention of something that is \"small\" and \"bezel-set\" stones in both answers, but these are part of very different items (a stone carving vs. silver jewelry with turquoise). The description of the material (dark gray stone vs. silver) and the subject of the depiction (a deity or spirit figure vs. a butterfly with turquoise) are completely different. Therefore, the generated response does not match the ground truth at all, justifying a low rating."
