In his own words \"The four sided box shows various Corn Maidens dressed in their traditional attire as they would be participating in dances held celebrating the Feast day of Saint Claire of Assisi at Santa Clara Pueblo on August 12. Saint Claire of Assisi is the patron saint of the blind, goldsmiths, embroiderers, and television. I use television antennas or satellite dishes in my work as a symbol/representation of St. Clara. As I created this piece, I felt that the male Corn dancer is the subject of the various Corn Maidens and he may be trying \u201cto juggle\u201d all of them as they are trying to get his attention. Another interpretation can be that the Corn Maidens may also be trying to warn each other of him. The four Corn Maidens also can represent four cardinal directions as well. All of the dancers are dressed in the manner of the Summer Moeity of which I am a member. The background is a continuous line of a silhouetted house/building/etc of Santa Clara Pueblo or Kha\u2019Po Owinge\u2019-meaning \u201cRose Path Village\u201d in Tewa. Some of the buildings include the Santa Clara Pueblo Catholic Church and a kiva with a ladder emerging from the rooftop entrance. Various television antennas and direct satellite dishes are included as well.\""

I appropriated the box cover art and made some minor and major changes to it. The vignettes reflect my upbringing and observations of Santa Clara Pueblo or Kha\u2019Po Owinge\u2019-\u201cRose Path village\u201d, this is the Tewa name and refers to wild roses that grew along the water ways of the Santa Clara Creek and the Rio Grande River, when the Pueblo was settled in the 1300s after a major drought forced our ancestors to move from the Pajarito Plateau to seek closer water sources.\nThe back of the piece has various codes that are a specific succession of buttons that when entered can change different variables of the game play. The codes that are on the back are:\nR2 X L1 L1 L2 L2 O STORMY\nR2 X L1 L1 L2 L2 L2 X FOGGY\nR2 X L1 L1 L2 L2 L2 \u2610 CLOUDY\n\u00e9 X \u00e7 \u00e8 R1 \u00e7 \u00ea \u00e9 \u0394 INFINITE HEALTH\nThe codes that entered reflect the ceremonial songs and prayers that are incantations for rain, prosperity , and long life.\nKey to vignettes:\nA-Puje Cliffs and Village is the Ancestral home of Santa Clara Pueblo. Puje= \u201cwhere rabbits gather\u201d, the Tewa name of our ancestral home. It refers to the ancestors who referred to themselves as P\u2019u Towa or \u2018rabbit people\u2019. Puje is said to have been a major gathering place for many villages that were spread out among the Pajarito Plateau.\nB-This vignette is directly lifted from the game cover art, in that it shows a main character of the game. The background shows a silhouette of Pueblo homes in the background and the street signs show the location of where I grew up. On the corner of Agoyo and Nava Alley. Agoyo meaning \u201cstar\u201d and Nava meaning \u201cfield\u201d both in the Tewa language.\nC-The image of the girl is directly appropriated from the cover art.\nD-The red polished carved pot represents the strong pottery traditions that have and continue to remain a part of Santa Clara Pueblo\u2019s identity and culture. The water serpent carved is a symbol of water. This image was inspired by a pot created by the late Teresita Naranjo.\nE-The table games/blackjack player represents the economic development efforts made by Santa Clara Pueblo. Currently the Pueblo, operates a casino in Espanola, the neighboring town, called the The Santa Claran Hotel and Casino. Casino and gaming enterprises offer financial security for some Tribes/Pueblos, but also offers many social problems as well.\nF-The vignette shows the Jemez Mountains experiencing a catastrophic forest fire. In 1998/Oso Complex Fire and 2000/Cerro Grande Fire burned over 8,500 acres of the Santa Clara Canyon. In 2011, the Las Conchas burned 16,000+ acres of the Santa Clara Canyon which included the upper watershed of the Santa Clara Creek leading to major erosion and closure of the Santa Clara Canyon to visitation.\nG-This vignette shows the Summer moiety kiva at Santa Clara Pueblo of which I belong to. The kiva is the ceremonial building in which many Pueblo ceremonies take place. This kiva was built in the mid-2000s and was part of the Pueblo\u2019s efforts to build new kivas and renovate old kivas after the Cerro Grande Fire. This is a representation of how strong Pueblo cultural traditions are and how they will be continued into the 21st century for many generations to come.\nF-The Corn Maiden holds a flip phone that is taking a photo or recording a video. This is a representation of technologies role in the continuance and destruction of a culture. Technology can be a tool to save and promote cultural ideals/languages/etc. But it can also be detrimental as well. The Corn Maiden is also a symbol in my work that represents Mother Earth and how we care for her in our actions and inactions.\""

The other two antler prongs were sawed off to make striking edges of the head. All but the sawed off edges have been polished. There are two holes drilled into the handle, probably to hold a hand strap. A square mirror is inset on the front face of the club head. It is held by eight small nails. At each end of the four corners of the inset there is a tack hammered into the antler. On the front face above the mirror is an engraved bison. The edges of the face are decorated with triangular line engravings. There are also nine circles with geometric designs engraved. Each engraving surrounds a hole which originally were set with tacks. On the reverse face, seven animal figures are engraved: 2 bison, 1 deer, 2 badgers, and 2 stylized animals. These animals surround a worm-like water monster with lines emitting from its eyes. Triangles similar to the front face outline the engravings. Bands of etched lines continue half-way down the handle."

The hilt is an extension of the blade and of the same copper wrapped with a caribou hide strip. The pommel is made from musk-ox horn and represents a wolf. The wolf's eyes are inlaid with abalone shell and bands of copper cover the lips, eyebrows, and nostrils, each secured with tiny copper nails. The wolf's tongue is also made from copper. A plate at the base of the blade is also made from musk-ox horn and is held in place with copper rivets. Lighter patina on pommel compared to NA1288B, an almost identical dagger. Fits with dagger sheath NA1288C."

A bib or yoke below the collar has floral decoration made with dyed porcupine quills on a hide background. The shoulder panel and the area where the sleeves are attached to the body of the coat are lined with hide fringe. The cuffs and lower hem panel are framed with a thin, white band and trimmed with blue cloth. Although this caribou hide jacket was collected among the Tlingit, the fringing along the shoulders and the quilled decoration on the yoke are distinctly Athapaskan (Kaplan and Barsness, 1986 p. 168)."

Backing is original (embroidery is stitched through). All fabrics are plain-weave cotton\u2014two sections are quite threadbare. The main backing fabric is currently tan (may have lost color) and has a faint pattern of fixed (yellow and green -- green only seems achievable with synthetic) and repelled motifs (white) to form a diamond lattice design with flowers and diamonds in alternating colors. The other two patterned fabrics are red: one is red with pink dots, yellow flowers, small white flowers, and green dots; the other is red with pink dots and yellow, white, and green bandhani work (thin strip at the border).

The composition, scale, and subject matter of a centralized tree in an arched niche of this hanging recall the tradition of elaborately worked zardozi qanat (tent hangings) in Mughal courts. However, this is likely a later example, perhaps made for the European export market in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century when there was a fashion for ornate beetle wing embroideries. Beetle wing embroideries for European export during the colonial period were mostly produced in Chennai (Madras) and Calcutta; however, this type of zardozi work could have been produced in many different centers for zardozi work, including Agra, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Lahore, Lucknow, Surat, and Varanasi (Benares). Backed with red cotton. Related objects in the Penn Museum: 29-96-83, 29-96-84, and 29-96-216 (a near-exact match)."

Most likely from Varanasi, early 20th century. Silk warp is dyed bright cyan with synthetic dyes. Field design consists of sparsely placed floral motifs (butti) in horizontal stripes; motif orientation alternates on each stripe. Border scroll design along length and pallu (end piece) of alternating flowers and leaves - woven in one piece with designs stopping at corners (not resolved). Floral design reminiscent of baroque damasks (European market) and Mughal design repertoire. The ends of the patterning wefts are looped back in, so although there is a 'face' (gold fills floral motifs) and 'reverse' (gold surrounds floral motifs) side, the sari is fully reversible. Two bands of open warp precede the fringed edges. Changeable blue and gold silk with gold bullion woven in widely spaced bands of floral motifs and in a conventionalized floral border. Both ends fringed."

Design is applied with roghan (an adhesive mixture) mixed with metallic powders such as ground mica or glitter, and stenciled on with a brass stencil (sancha). This method is a much more cost-effective imitation of both zardozi embroidery and amru brocade (see object no. 88-16-40 in our collection). The design of the field consists of small alternating dots and floral motifs (butti). The pallu (end piece) contains two bands of butas in neat rows. The butas closer to the field (first row) are smaller and more squat, while those in the second row are larger and have a more pronounced curving tip."

        "answer": "Blue-green shawl with paisley pear motif design painted on in gold paint. Dyed, plain-weave cotton printed using the khari technique.  Design is applied with roghan (an adhesive mixture) mixed with metallic powders such as ground mica or glitter, and stenciled on with a brass stencil (sancha). This method is a much more cost-effective imitation of both zardozi embroidery and amru brocade (see object no. 88-16-40 in our collection). The design of the field consists of small alternating dots and floral motifs (butti). The pallu (end piece) contains two bands of butas in neat rows. The butas closer to the field (first row) are smaller and more squat, while those in the second row are larger and have a more pronounced curving tip."
