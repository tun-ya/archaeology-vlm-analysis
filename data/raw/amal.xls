This painting represents Buddha surrounded by sixteen benign guardians who include the Chinese monk Xuanzang his attendant, the converted demon Jinja Taisho (深沙大将), and 14 bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas are dressed in celestial attire. Xuanzang is dressed in customary monks' robes with a backpack full of sutras. Among the numerous sutras he carried on back from India during his pilgrimage ( 629-645 CE) is the Mahaprajna Paramita, the Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom. This important and voluminous sutra, which he translated, quickly gained popularity in China and became a principle text in East Asian Buddhism. Thus, this painting is the pictorial representation of the essence of the sutra - Buddhist wisdom through enlightenment. It also serves as a visual reminder of the merits of Xuanzang, whose deification made him a role model. Many versions of this theme are still extant.

Native clay and native slip. In his own words ""The four sided box shows various Corn Maidens dressed in their traditional attire as they would be participating in dances held celebrating the Feast day of Saint Claire of Assisi at Santa Clara Pueblo on August 12. Saint Claire of Assisi is the patron saint of the blind, goldsmiths, embroiderers, and television. I use television antennas or satellite dishes in my work as a symbol/representation of St. Clara. As I created this piece, I felt that the male Corn dancer is the subject of the various Corn Maidens and he may be trying “to juggle” all of them as they are trying to get his attention. Another interpretation can be that the Corn Maidens may also be trying to warn each other of him. The four Corn Maidens also can represent four cardinal directions as well. All of the dancers are dressed in the manner of the Summer Moeity of which I am a member. The background is a continuous line of a silhouetted house/building/etc of Santa Clara Pueblo or Kha’Po Owinge’-meaning “Rose Path Village” in Tewa. Some of the buildings include the Santa Clara Pueblo Catholic Church and a kiva with a ladder emerging from the rooftop entrance.

In the artist's own words: ""The piece is inspired by the video game series Grand Theft Auto, the game is set in a fictional city named San Andreas. I appropriated the box cover art and made some minor and major changes to it. The vignettes reflect my upbringing and observations of Santa Clara Pueblo or Kha’Po Owinge’-“Rose Path village”, this is the Tewa name and refers to wild roses that grew along the water ways of the Santa Clara Creek and the Rio Grande River, when the Pueblo was settled in the 1300s after a major drought forced our ancestors to move from the Pajarito Plateau to seek closer water sources.
The back of the piece has various codes that are a specific succession of buttons that when entered can change different variables of the game play. The codes that are on the back are:
R2 X L1 L1 L2 L2 O STORMY
R2 X L1 L1 L2 L2 L2 X FOGGY
R2 X L1 L1 L2 L2 L2 ☐ CLOUDY
é X ç è R1 ç ê é Δ INFINITE HEALTH
The codes that entered reflect the ceremonial songs and prayers that are incantations for rain, prosperity , and long life.
Key to vignettes:
A-Puje Cliffs and Village is the Ancestral home of Santa Clara Pueblo. Puje= “where rabbits gather”, the Tewa name of our ancestral home. It refers to the ancestors who referred to themselves as P’u Towa or ‘rabbit people’. Puje is said to have been a major gathering place for many villages that were spread out among the Pajarito Plateau.
B-This vignette is directly lifted from the game cover art, in that it shows a main character of the game. The background shows a silhouette of Pueblo homes in the background and the street signs show the location of where I grew up. On the corner of Agoyo and Nava Alley. Agoyo meaning “star” and Nava meaning “field” both in the Tewa language.
C-The image of the girl is directly appropriated from the cover art.
D-The red polished carved pot represents the strong pottery traditions that have and continue to remain a part of Santa Clara Pueblo’s identity and culture. The water serpent carved is a symbol of water. This image was inspired by a pot created by the late Teresita Naranjo.
E-The table games/blackjack player represents the economic development efforts made by Santa Clara Pueblo. Currently the Pueblo, operates a casino in Espanola, the neighboring town, called the The Santa Claran Hotel and Casino. Casino and gaming enterprises offer financial security for some Tribes/Pueblos, but also offers many social problems as well.
F-The vignette shows the Jemez Mountains experiencing a catastrophic forest fire. In 1998/Oso Complex Fire and 2000/Cerro Grande Fire burned over 8,500 acres of the Santa Clara Canyon. In 2011, the Las Conchas burned 16,000+ acres of the Santa Clara Canyon which included the upper watershed of the Santa Clara Creek leading to major erosion and closure of the Santa Clara Canyon to visitation.
G-This vignette shows the Summer moiety kiva at Santa Clara Pueblo of which I belong to. The kiva is the ceremonial building in which many Pueblo ceremonies take place. This kiva was built in the mid-2000s and was part of the Pueblo’s efforts to build new kivas and renovate old kivas after the Cerro Grande Fire. This is a representation of how strong Pueblo cultural traditions are and how they will be continued into the 21st century for many generations to come.
F-The Corn Maiden holds a flip phone that is taking a photo or recording a video. This is a representation of technologies role in the continuance and destruction of a culture. Technology can be a tool to save and promote cultural ideals/languages/etc. But it can also be detrimental as well. The Corn Maiden is also a symbol in my work that represents Mother Earth and how we care for her in our actions and inactions.""",30.48 cm,,,0 cm,,,Ceramic,,2013-14-2,Grand Theft Auto,TC-2013-2-2 - Old Loan Number,,,New Mexico | Santa Clara Pueblo,American,,,,1.27 cm,22.86 cm

Rose is the daughter of Roxanne Swentzell, and a member of the famous Naranjo family from Santa Clara Pueblo. In her words, ""American Gothic is about the personal relationship with the masculine and feminine parts of myself."" (personal communication w L.Fowler WIlliams, 2015). A self-portrait, the piece shows Rose as a woman, but also as a man. It tells of her personal story, while simultaneously commenting on Western and Pueblo concepts of gender. Rose references Western gender concepts by situating herself against the backdrop of Grant Wood's iconic American painting. She expresses Tewa concepts of gender in the piece as well, which conceptualize human gender as composed of both male and famale aspects, which in her words, ""should be kept in balance as we live as a ""whole person."" Rose dressed her feminine side in traditional Pueblo woman's attire - a black woolen woven manta dress tied over her right shoulder with a woven belt. She dressed her male side in typical Pueblo man's dance attire - a ribbon shirt tied at the waist with the man's white woven cotton sash and a shell and turgouise necklace. The portrait is set outside an adobe home under a cloudy sky. He holds two black and white striped goose feathers tied together with cotton string, a reference to prayer feathers, and also, through their balanced black and white stripes, a reference to Rose's ""two-spirit"" identity. Rose herself wears a tatoo of a flock of geese across her back, which she says is a reference to her two spirit identity.",47.3 cm,,,0 cm,,Santa Clara Pueblo,Wood | Stoneware | Adobe | Goose Feather,,2015-25-1,American Gothic,,,,New Mexico | Pojoaque Pueblo | Santa Clara Pueblo,American,,,,,39.5 cm

Her style includes the use of multiple, linear, all-black design motiffs, a fairly vertical basket wall, diagonal finishing stitch, and non-interlocked stitching. Some baskets made by Agnes May Pete passed through the hands of Abe Cohn (Cohn's Emporium in Carson City, Nevada). The Emporium was the conduit for the work of many known Washoe basket weavers in the late 19th/early 20th century in response to the growing popularity of the Lake Tahoe area as a tourist destination. In his writings about Washoe basketry, Marvin Cohodas, Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia, calls the period between 1895-1935 the time of Washoe ""fancy basketry.""",11.43 cm,,,,,,Willow | Fern,Degikup,2020-8-1,,,19.05 cm,,United States of America | Nevada | Carson Valley,American,,,,,

Behind the animal is the second deity, (Taraqu), who wears a conical cap. Against the back of his head is written the Hittite Hieroglyph meaning ""first"". In front of the latter deity is an ass, near which is a Hittite hieroglyph as yet undecipherable.
Rowe: The Hittite seal is of hematite and is by far the most important of its kind found in Palestine. On it are represented two deities and also an elephant (this is the first occurance of the animal on cylinder seals) with a vulture above it. Before the elephant stands one of the deities who holds an axe (?) in his right hand. In front of his head is the Hittite hieroglyph usually read as ""god"". Behind the elephant is the other deity, who wears a conical cap. Against the back of his head is the hieroglyph probably meant ""fort"".

Kudurru
From Hinke's book on the Kudurru:
""It contains a drawing of the field in question, together with an accompanying description, which precedes the inscription proper.... A second peculiarity is a beautiful hymn to Ellil, at the beginning of the inscription. It was no doubt taken from the liturgical collections of hymns in use at Nippur. It is the finest Ellil hymn which has been found thus far, fitly celebrating the majesty and power of the god of Nippur.... The stonecutter has not always been accurate in engraving he inscription. There are several erasures. The inscription consists of the following divisions: (1) The heading, containing the name of the stone, in two lines, written between the symbols. (2) The plot of the field, accompanied by a description of eight lines. (3) A hymn in honor of Ellil, the god of Nippur. (4) The historical circumstances under which the land was given to Nusku-ibni, a high dignitary of Ekur, the temple of Ellil at Nippur. (5) The measuring of the land under the supervision of Baushum-iddina, the governor of Big-Sin-sheme, in response to a royal command; a more detailed description of the field and its actual transfer to Nusku-ibni. (6) The curses: (a) introduction to the curses, forbidding any official to appropriate the land or interfere with the privileges of the owner (b) Invocation of the gods and the punishments they are asked to mete out to any offender (c) Curses directed against any one removing or destroying the boundary stone. (7) The fourteen witnesses present at the transaction. (8) The date of the inscription.""",49.5 cm,,,,,,Stone,,29-20-1,,,,Nebuchadnezzar I,Iraq | Nippur,Near Eastern,,,,,23.5 cm

This beautiful relief from the northwestern region of Gandhara displays three different scenes from top to bottom. At the top stands the Buddha adored by two attendants, while in the center the Buddha is seated as he receives the adoration of four devotees. At the bottom is a fine and characteristic rendering of the 'great passing away' of the Buddha from his earthly existence. Lying on a bed, he is surrounded by his disciples who express the tremendous anguish they feel at the loss of their spiritual leader. To the right of the Buddha's feet is Ananda, his favorite disciple, to whom he has just delivered his last teaching. The Gandhara style is best understood as a provincial expression of the late antique style of Rome. This 'classical' influence is evident in the treatment of the figures, the robes they wear, and in the line of acanthus leaves used to separate the bottom scene from the middle one. Originally, this carved fragment was part of a stone revetment of a Buddhist stupa (reliquary mound) positioned so that worshippers who came to honor the Buddha would see the events of his life and learn of his spiritual accomplishments.",57.1 cm,Buddha | Bodhisattvas | Nirvana | Worshipper | Subhadra | Vajrapani,,,,,Slate,,29-64-223,,,,,Pakistan | Gandhara,Asian,,,Carved | Bas Relief,,39.9 cm

The central figure is Siddhartha Buddha seated on a lotus above a lion throne in the attitude of Calling the Earth (to witness his victory over evil) also known as bhumisparsa mudra. This took place at Bodh Gaya. Seven other scenes of significant events in his life are, from his right: 1. Birth. From the right side of his mother as she stands under a tree (at Kapilavastu). 2. Descent from Heaven. He had gone to proclaim the doctrine to his mother (Sankacya). 3. Miracle. While preaching the law, he multiplied his image to convince unbelievers of his power (Sravasti). 4. Parinirvana. His death (Kushinagara). 5. Preaching the first sermon (Deer Park, Sarnath). 6. Taming the maddened elephant (Rajagrha). 7. Offering of the monkey (near Vaisali). This stela is perhaps the earliest of the type popular in Bengal during the Pala Period, 9th-12th century CE. The scenes which may differ in detail and placement around the central figure represent the four great events of Birth, Enlightenment, First Sermon, Death, and the four secondary events. The locations at which these took place correspond to the eight great pilgrimage sites. A 6"" miniature of the type, presumably carried from India by a monk or pilgrim, was recovered from the crypt of Wat Rajaburana, Ayutthaya, Thailand, built around 1424 CE. Polished black granulite. There is a Buddhist confession of faith written in Sanskrit in Bengali script below.
The inscription reads: सिद्धं // ये धर्म्मा हेतुप्रभवो तेषां हेतुं तथागतो / ह्य् अवदत् तेषां च यो निरोध एवंवादी महाश्रामणः // (siddhaṃ // ye dharmmā hetuprabhavo teṣāṃ hetuṃ tathāgato / hy avadat teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃvādī mahāśrāmaṇaḥ //) ""Regarding those laws which arise from a cause, the Buddha (Thus Gone One) has taught their cause and their destruction. This is the teaching of the Great Ascetic.""

As one of the deities in the vast Tantric pantheon, she is usually depicted with a musical instrument in her hands and mounted on a peacock. When Tantric Buddhism penetrated Tibet, China, and Japan, Sarasvati worship entered as well. Influenced by local traditions, Sarasvati, like many Tantric deities, assumed different functions in each region. In Japan, the majority of Benzaiten images are revered as ones which confer happiness, wealth, longevity, and fame. She is frequently depicted holding eight attributes, including a sword, spear, ax, bow, arrow, lasso, thunderbolt and wheel of the law. According to the inscription on the back of the portrait, it was once housed in the Shinto shrine in Itsukushima, Hiroshima prefecture. The red lacquer Torii gate, sacred symbol of this famed shrine which is depicted on her crown, supports this provenience. The small head placed in Benzaiten's crown, a Tantric iconographic trait, seems to represent a Shinto monk. Thus, this rare embroidered portrait illustrates the Shinto-Buddhist syncretism known as Dual Shinto.

This seal was found under the body of ""individual no. 7,"" who was collapsed in the corner of the death pit near the cluster of three magnificent lyres - one of gold, one of silver, and one a large bull effigy lyre of mixed materials. In addition to the seal, the victim was rather sedately adorned, wearing only gold earrings, hair wires, a gold pin with a fluted lapis lazuli ball head, three gold fingers, a ""dog collar"" necklace of gold and lapis lazuli, and a lapis lazuli bead necklace. The seal is a finely carved double-register banquet scene that carries an inscription giving a title and personal name Dumukisal. Combining elements of other banquet seals, here three seated celebrants are show in the upper register: two face each other and drink through tubes from a large vessel; the other raises her hand in a gesture to a standing servant. Curiously, the inscription is placed between these two figures, without regard for their obvious narrative coherence. Across the lower register is an elaborate scene of dancing, singing, and musical performance. From the left, a man carrying a staff over his shoulder is preceded by two females clapping cymbals. This group faces a woman playing a bull lyre.

UE X: the god of atmosphere, goad and whip in hands, rides standing on his primitive chariot drawn by a mythical dragon. His wife, holding right and let in her extended hands two S-shaped thunderbolts, stands erect between the wings of the monster. A quiver hangs from her shoulders. Her head is turned back facing the god. Both wear the horned mitre and long hair, flowing down the shoulders of the goddess but tied into a chignon for the god. Her dress is a tight-fitting robe; his, a pleated skirt and belt.
The dragon is half-lion half-eagle, with claws and feather tail. Its head, lowered down, is belching forth mist, rain and a powerful roar.
The chariot, wheel, pole, splash board, fenced sides, and back drop, is almost a copy of the copper Pre-dynastic model found at Tell-Agrab, with the driver standing astride the massive body. THe god's cloak, discarded, hangs over the back.
The owner of the seal, Ur-gis-me-e, stands before the chariot raising one hand in sign of worship. He wears a tunic, an open shawl hanging from the waist down, beard and long hair tied in a chignon, and a mitre with one pair of horns and central feathers, of Pre-Sargonid style.

Field design of small floral sprigs in diagonal lines; the same motif is repeated but the orientation alternates, tilting up to the right then down to the right. Small knots sparsely fill the remaining space. The mulberry silk satin in very dark blue (nearly black) and the allover embroidery worked completely in knots (seed stitches; Gujarati: khako) in floss silk identifies the jhabla as likely embroidered in China or by Chinese embroiderers in Surat, Gujarat. The Parsi market for Chinese embroideries emerged from the involvement of Parsi merchants in the so-called 'China trade' of Indian opium and cotton for Chinese tea exported to Britain in the 19th century. The flowing arrangement of the floral border design draws from Chinese embroidery motifs, distinguishing the design from the more regularized repeats of the floral borders commonly found on embroideries produced in Gujarat for domestic markets during this period (compare with object number 43-12-60.

Said to be one of a collection of oracle bones obtained by Langdon Warner in 1913-14 at the village of Xiaotun at the site of Anyang. Shang Dynasty kings used oracle bones as a form of divination to seek supernatural guidance about important political, social, and personal issues. Usually created from cattle shoulder blades and the underside of turtle shells, the bones were smoothed and then heated until they cracked. By interpreting the cracks, royal diviners believed they were receiving insight that allowed them to answer questions about the future. In many cases, a record of the reading was written on the bones. These texts provide invaluable information about early Chinese religion, politics, and elite life.",5.5 cm,,Chinese Language,,,,Bone,,55-34-7,,15-44-60 - Peabody Number | D836 - Other Number,,Shang Dynasty,China | Henan | Anyang | Xiaotun,Asian,,,Inscribed,,2.2 cm

Muscarella Publication: ""Greater part of a human head in the round; part of the right side and the back are missing, and the nose and part of the upper lip are broken away. The head is similar to no. 123 but not so finely executed: here the long chin is wide and without a cleft, the mouth is wider, and instead of a neck there is a rectangular peg for insertion into a separately made body or other unit. Eyes are oval with traces of a black substance within, probably a glue; heavy brows in relief meet over the eyes; the ear is large and S-shaped as on the relief, and pierced for an earring. Two electrum earrings found in Room 6 still contained ivory which indicates that they belonged to a statuette like this: Muscarella 1966, fig. 36. (Note that an earring of exactly the same type was found in 1970 in CC32) A circular hole, 3.3 cm. in depth and ca. 2 cm. in diameter was cut into the top, no doubt to hold a headdress; above the forehead the head is inset and was probably covered by the headdress.

On the L there is a flange at which point there is a repousse rib followed by a further flange which is pierced by rivet holes. There is also a row of 5 rivets along hte bottom edge, three of which preserve the rivets in place; all these holes were probably to attach the metal part to a leather section on the left and bottom. Smooth uniform very dk. green patina with some lighter patched, rougher inside. Whitish incrustation along L side. At the upper R corner of the inside and against the flange is an area of rough red corrosion which may be the remains of an iron object (an arrowhead?). Preserved are two complete and one fragmentary frieze bordered by rather carelessly drawn bands containing bud chains as on 67-39-22 but without punched circles. Bands are bordered by two incised lines above and below; between the uppermost and middle frieze are two bud bands separated by a space. Decoration, with the exception of the bud bands, is in high repousse with details added by tracing and engraving similar to 67-39-22 in technique (but less simlar in style). The friezes undoubtedly continue past the break at the R to the other side of the quiver since the decoration is not symmetrically placed on the preserved portion and is broken off at edge. Preserved portion of each frieze is identical: starting from L edge is a worshipper or deity in a long robe facing R toward a tongue-shaped stela with a stylized tree motif engraved, followed by a similar figure facing L and another facing R toward a second stella. Each wears a squarish horned headdress and holds a small bucket (with the exception of the L figure on the middle frieze where it has been omitted through oversight) in the L hand; the R hand is held upraised toward the stela. Robes are fringed and decorated near the bottom by three groups of three punched dots. The faces are very summarily indicated, sometimes with a single double-looped S-line to show eyes, hair, and curl at bottom; 2 horizontal lines for nose and mouth. Stelai are different from 67-39-22; punched circles nowhere used on this piece.",,Figure | Basket | Tree,,17.94 cm,,,Bronze,,67-39-26,,,,,Iran (uncertain) | Turkey (uncertain),Mediterranean,,,,0.15 cm,9.24 cm

Jaipaul-Wardlaw and Rosita Jaipaul, in honor of their parents Dr. and Mrs. Jaipaul, 1987",,Indian | Hindu,Collections Storage,17th Century,,"Carved and painted wood statue of kneeling figure of Ravana, Hindu deity with nine heads and nineteen arms. Ravana is a giant figure in Indian mythology. He is often called the ""Demon-King of Lanka"", traditionally associated with the modern nation and island of Sri Lanka. Taking the evil-genius theme, Indian story tellers created a persona who is said to have been as smart and strong as ten men. This is why he is often portrayed with ten heads and twenty arms. This wooden statue is representative of south Indian portrayals of Ravana. If you count the heads there are only nine. The Indian artist elected to sacrifice the literal notion of ten heads in favor of symmetry, with a central head evenly flanked by four others. Orginially there were twenty arms. The skin of the figure is painted red with yellow paint on the short, lower, garment and ornamentation which includes crowns, earrings, necklaces, arm bands, anklets. Right arms: 1) Far right palm open supporting heads; 2) In front of right side of chest with palm open and upward; 3) Above right knee holding Khadga (sword); 4) Lowered hand grasping object which is currently missing, probably for Gada (club); 5) Downward with palm open and facing down; 6) Lowered holding Shula (spear); 7) To front holding Naga (snake); 8) Front and upward holding handle with top broken off, probably for Trishula (trident); 9) Upward holding Vajra (bolt of lightening); 10)Straight to right side holding Ghanta (bell).

Written in Pali with note and colophon in Thai (Pali in Khom script; Thai in Thai script). Manuscript tells the story of Phra Malai, a Buddhist monk, who visited heaven and hell, receiving instruction from Maitreya in heaven. He subsequently returns and transmits what he has learned to his followers. Most likely a village manuscript not produced with royal backing. The text is usually chanted at funerals and is interspersed with extracts from the Pali canon Abhidhamma (chet kamphi) and the Thai Phra Malai tale. (1. f.A02-A05: Abhidhamma chet kamphi -- 2.f.A05-46B: Phra Malai.) A note in the text of the manuscript advises the monk after finishing the previous three prayers to take and break and drink hot tea (f. B12). Donor names are penciled on the cover. Images include a depiction of the constellations around Mt. Meru, the center of Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, around which celestial objects were imagined to revolve. Sides are brown. Both ends have slightly shiny brown colored painting, lacquer or glue. Manuscript has come apart in several places. Donated to a monastery for a funeral by a woman nicknamed Older Sister Nu (mouse; colophon in pencil, f. B47). Written in central Thailand, probably in the 1870s or 1880s. 13 illustrated folios with images of deities (f. A02-A04) and episodes from the Phra Malai (f. A06, A26-A27, A41, B12-B13, B26-B27, B37, B46).

A printed, plain-weave cotton fabric comes between the front of the rumal and its red backing -- it is visible through damaged sections of the embroidered hashiya and appears to be roller-printed. The jamawar (raw fabric) has been repurposed into a rumal from multiple pieces, and in different sewing techniques that evidence multiple repairs. The design of the jamawar is done in a kani tapestry weave. The weave construction is a 2/2 weft-faced twill. The design of the jamawar consists of two alternating stripe designs: one contains two types of butas-one with a border, one without-that alternate but are facing the same direction; the other contains a trellis. The style of the butas align with examples from the early 19th century. The design of repeating arched niches embroidered on the border (hashiya) resembles designs popular for the pallu (decorative end pieces) on European-market and dorukha-style shawls from the later 19th century.",,Floral | Buta | Boteh,,45 cm,,,Silk | Cotton | Wool | Metallic Thread | Goat Hair,Rumal,A581,,,,19th Century,India | Kashmir,Asian,,,Tapestry Weave | Embroidered | Sewn,,45 cm

PBS XIV: The worshiping of two seated gods, Shamash and Ishtar. Shamash has rays arising from his shoulders, and his notched sword in hand. Ishtar carries a slender club, and six more are arising from his shoulders. Both are fighting deities, son and daughter of Sin whose shallow crescent is seen above. They have a horned mitre with feathers (?), their hair tied in a loop behind, a flounced shawl covering one shoulder, and plain cubic thrones with cross bars. There is a club behind Shamash. The divine attendant has the same mitre, hair and beard as Shamash, but only a plaited shawl about his middle, leaving arms and chest bare. In the rear a female worshiper brings a pail with liquid offerings. She has a bare head, her hair tied in a loop, and a fringed shawl covering one shoulder.

PBS XIV: The seal of Izgur-Marduk son of Kara-indash, BC1450.
The worshiping of the bearded god Shugamuna stepping forth like Martu but without any club in hand, on arm hanging, the other folded to his breast. He has a turban, his hair hanging on his shoulders, a short embroidered tunic girded about, with the three tassels of the belt hanging below the knee. A shawl covers one shoulder and falls down to the ankles, while opening in front to let pass the bare leg. A divine attendant adores with both hands up. She has a horned mitre, hair hair not tied in a loop but hanging, and a flounced robe. The beardless worshiper in turban - or a fillet - long hair, simple fringed robe, adores with both hands up.
The same scene is repeated six times with fourteen figures in two registers between the seven lines of inscription, as if the inscription was the main contribution and the scenes only filling a blank. The god is approached by the divine attendant or by the worshiper or stands between them, each one facing him in turn. The divine attendant is probably Shumalia the wife of Shugamuna, both national gods of the Cassites, and the worshiper may represent Izgur-Marduk a libator of Shugamuna according to his inscription.
Shugamuna,//brilliant lord,//with thy support may he come forth,//through thy decree may he prosper,//Izgur-Marduk,//the son of Karaindash,//the libator who reveres thee.

The rider wears a peaked cap with top turned over, flaps covering the ears and a tag down the back of the neck. The Parthian helmet represented on Parthian coins was apparently made of leather and dyed in purpose color, if we can trust painted terracottas from Cyprus. The man’s body and the horse’s neck are erect and elongated. The ride sits forward on the horse’s withers and seem to cling to the horses’ neck. His olegs and hands and the horse’ feet are rudimentary. More care has been given to the horse’s head with a long nose, a thick mane, a forelock and a top knot in many examples.

Statuette of a seated lady wearing a flounced garment and with her hands clasped together at her midriff. The panels of her chair are covered with an inscription in cuneiform.
The statuette was found badly broken in the temple of Ningal at Ur. It has been heavily restored, with the missing head and parts of the body replaced, based on similar statues. Originally thought to be a depiction of the goddess Ningal, original parts of the headdress were found and they are not the headdress of a goddess, but of a priestess. The inscription on the chair shows that the statuette was dedicated to Ningal by Enannatuma, high priestess at Ur and daughter of King Ishme-Dagan.

Two of the shafts had butts from which projected copper “forks,” which Woolley described as string notches for throwing thongs. Woolley reasoned that the length of the weapons , as well as their lightness and the fact that two of them had throwing forks, indicated that they were throwing spears or javelins similar to those used by the warriors in chariots depicted on the Standard of Ur.

This dark blue lapis lazuli cylinder seal was found leaning against the right upper arm of a queen. On it is engraved a double-register banquet scene with only female participants. All of the women wear a skirt or a dress with a long fringe, and their long hair is drawn together at the nape of the neck in a bun. In the upper register, two females sit on identical folding stools facing each other and raising their conical drinking cups. Between them, two standing servants gesture with raised hands, and to the far left a third servant stands gently waving a square fan. In a second banquet vignette in the lower register, a single female celebrant sits on a stool facing a high table laden with breads and a haunch of meat and is flanked by servants. Behind her, a woman holds a handled jar and raises a cup, perhaps offering a portion of beer to drink with the meal. To the side, a separate scene depicts a musical performance, in which one woman plays a small four-stringed instrument accompanied by two women who clap cymbals and perhaps sing. Two similar cylinder seals were found close to the body of the queen. On one, the banqueters drink from straws that drawn down liquid from a large jar. The other carries an inscription Pu-abi, nin designating the owner as Puabi, the queen. It is this seal that makes Puabi’s identity certain.

This seal was found with one of the grooms in the tomb pit of Puabi. Unlike the other four seals found in her tomb, this seal, carved from shell, carries a depiction of a combat scene – a fine example of the typical Early Dynastic IIIA combat scene, consisting of an unbroken figure band made up of five struggling figures. To the left, a hearo is shown wearing only a wrestling belt and with hair standing on end in large backward-turning curls. He wields a dagger and grapples a lion, who grasps a rampant cervid in his forelegs. The lion’s head is rendered as if seen from the top, indicating that he has turned his head to the side in order to take a bite of the animal’s neck. Overlapping the lion is a second rampant lion with a very full mane, which attacks a long-haired goat from behind. Beneath the goat’s chin is a small scorpion, and above his head, separated from the scene by two incised horizontal lines, is an inscription giving a male personal name, Lugal-sha-pa-da.

As Woolley noted, because this handle is quite thin, it must have been mounted together with a similar piece against a central slip of wood or metal. Its three holes would have served as a means of attaching it. The triangular arrangement of the holes calls to mind the positioning of the rivets that secured dagger blades to handles, and perhaps the piece was in fact part of the handle of a dagger.

PG 337 was the first royal tomb found by Woolley, and although it was small and had been plundered in antiquity, he determined from its contents that it was clearly a royal grave. In addition to the bodies of three victims, the tomb contained a pile of personal jewelry that was essentially identical to that of the most elaborately adorned women found in tombs uncovered later. Among the personal adornments Woolley found was this cylinder seal, carved of lapis lazuli with a double-register banquet scene. Apart from the fineness of its carving, the virtually identical images in the two registers distinguish this seal.

Mes-an-ni-pad-da. Two registers. Gilgamesh and rampant animals.
UE II: Cylinder seal, lapis-lazuli. two registers: above, hunter fighting with lions, and the inscription nin-TUR nin; below, a hunter with animals. This seal of the wife of Mes-anni-padda, first king of the 1st Dynasty of Ur, was found loose in the soil at a depth of 1.40m from the modern surface; ie on the level of the higher Sargonid graves and in or a little above the stratum of 1st Dynasty rubbish which covers the older cemetery. In any case it had probably been disturbed by the Sargonid grave-diggers, and it could not be determined whether it originally belonged to a grave of which no trace remains or to the 1st Dynasty rubbish stratum in which were found, in another part of the cemeterty, seal-impressions of her and of her husband's seals. The latter is far more probable, as there is no evidence here of 1st Dynasty graves, much less of 1st Dynasty royal graves.
Woolley was very lucky to find this seal in the loose soil above the royal tombs because through its inscription, Ninbanda, the wife of Mesannepada, we have a historical record of the first queen of the First Dynasty of Ur. It is interesting that the imagery of Ninbanda’s seal is also a combat scene, like that of her husband (seen impressed on sealing 31-16-677), but of a very different style. Ninbanda’s seal, cut from lapis lazuli, is a double-register composition. The lower register shows a five-combatant composition typical of the Royal Cemetery period, but in the upper register the composition has changed. Here the hero is in the middle, protecting two rampant bovids who are being attacked from each side by lions. The sense of a decorative band is still present, but the figures do not overlap. The quality of the carving on this seal is not as fine as on that of her husband, Mesannepada.",,,Sumerian Language,4.1 cm,,,Lapis Lazuli,,B16852,,U.8981 - Field No SF | P247685 - CDLI Number,1.3 cm,Early Dynastic IIIB,Iraq | Ur,Near Eastern,,,,,

""ca. 2600-2500BC. This votive limestone plaque carved in low relief is one of the earliest representations of equids used as draft animals. Here, apparently four equids are shown under one yoke, pulling a cart with two solid wheels. The driver walks behind the vehicle. As was usual at this time, the equids were hitched with collars placed high on their necks, revealing the adaptation of the yoke from use on bovids to which to was well suited. Owing to differences in anatomy, this was a cruide and inefficient procedure for harnessing equids, for the pulling strap was placed so that it cut off their breathing. In more recent times, this has been corrected through the use of the horse collar which lowers the point of stress to the chest of the Animal. A plaque from Khafaje, Iraq, shows the heds of the equids which are broken away on this plaque.""",13 cm,Chariot | Lion | Groom,,,,,Limestone,,B17086,,U.8557 - Field No SF,,,Iraq | Ur,Near Eastern,,,,,27 cm

This wreath was found above the other wreaths on the skull of Queen Puabi in grave 800 in the Royal Cemetery at Ur. Here three willow leaves are gathered 11 times, and two are gathered twice. In between the gathered leaves are lapis and paste flowers (13 of them) which have alternating lapis and paste petals around a gold center with a lapis bead at the center of that. The flowers themselves are gold. All of the willow leaves are tipped in a carnelian ring, but for one which is missing it. [and one, which is broken] . Unlike the poplar leaves on her other crowns, these are not one piece of gold, but the central leaf seems to be the solid one that is folded over on itself for the bead joiner. There are three holes created, which mean there are three strings of beads between each element. There are also three holes through the flowers, again, creating three strands between element. the pattern appears to be: top strand, alternating gold and lapis balls; middle strand: alternating gold and lapis squat biconical beads; and the bottom strand has alternating gold and lapis pendants separated by a small lapis ball.

He steps on a naked enemy laying on his back with hands up in fear and prayer. The worshiper, a Sumerian shaven and shorn, provably the scribe owner of the seal, stands in front of the king with clasped hand, a necklace emblem of his dignity and a fringed shawl covering his left shoulder.

PBS XIV: The triumph of a warrior god and of Ishtar over her enemy. The god steps over mountains like Shamash, but his arms are different. He has one axe in the left, and in the right the shaft of a colossal caduceus, a club with two curved blades terminating in lions’ heads on either side of the round head. This is the emblem of the god Ninib. His shawl is not open in front to allow a free action of the bare leg, but is rather a loin cloth, closing behind like the old Sumerian skirt. Chest and arms are bare. He has the horned mitre, a beard, and his hair tied in a loop behind. The mount below his foot is rather a stage tower symbol of his residence and temple.
Ishtar stands in front face with weapons on her shoulders, and locks on either side, a horned mitre, a flounced robe covering both shoulders, in the very attitude of the war goddess Innana leading prisoners until Anubanini, king of the Lulubi, on the rock reliefs of the Zagros. With the help of a divine attendant she seizes her enemy at body and arm. The prisoner has a horned mitre, a beard, his hair tied in a loop, a plaited shawl girded about his middle, and a curved club, with projecting blade terminating in a lion’s head. He is certainly a war god. And this is perhaps an episode of the triumph of Ishtar over the god of Hades. The attendant who arrests the god and pulls down his mitre, wears a flounced shawl girded about his middle and opening in front, and a strange headdress with staghorns (?).

In the center of the relief, behind the body of the reclining male is a small male figure holding to his left side an amphora with high-swung handles and body decorated in relief (honeycomb body, neck ornament, and tongues on neck). He is dressed in a long-sleeved tunic with a central vertical panel. His hair is rendered as a halo of globular curls. ANother small male figure appears to the far left in the relief, wearing a long-sleeved patterned tunic with a deep kolpos, trousers, and pointed-toed boots. He holds a cup to the front of his body in his right hand, and a ladle with a looped handle in his bent left hand; he wears a sword at his right side. His hair is treated in the same way as the other servant. The ground line for the scene is a rolled mattress or pillow with vertical striations.
Between the two small figures are two vertical lines of an inscription in Palmyrene dialect of Aramaic. ""Malku, son of Moquimu. Alas!"" The back is roughly finished.""
Fowlkes-Child & Seymour: ""Catalogue 109 depicts Malku reclining on a mattress and holding a bowl in his left hand a fruit in his right. His long-sleeved, belted tunic is embellished with a pattern of double palm fronds on its central vertical band and additional patterns at the cuffs and lower edge. A chlamys (cloak) is pinned at his right shoulder, a dagger hangs from his belt, and his boots are square toed with a central flap. A dorsalium (curtain) is pinned with rosettes to palm fronds behind him. Two young male attendants stand behind Malku, one holding an amphora, and the other a ladle and a cup. Their matching tunics have simpler embroidery than Malku's. Trousers, pointed boots, and a dagger hanging from the waist are visible on the figure on the left.

Romano: ""Inscribed rectangular loculus slab with richly ornamented female figure in high relief. Woman is in frontal position with right arm bent and crossed over in front of body at waist height grasping the edge of her mantle. The left arm is bent and is raised to grasp the edge of the veil at shoulder height. She wears a tunic with a mantle fastened with a large circular jeweled brooch at the left shoulder and looped over her bare right forearm. She also wears a veil over the top of her head, the edge of which is scalloped and falls down the right side of the chest. Beneath the veil she wears a high, rolled turban with patterns in relief of rosettes, dots and narrow bands.
Attached at the front of the turban is a pin with a rectangle linked to an oval jewel with three drops pendant on the forehead. Around her head she also wears a hair chain with circular jewels linked to each other. She wears drop earrings with a deeply drilled separation from the cheek. She wears four necklaces: the uppermost is rolled with a circular pendant; the second a chain with a circular pendant; the third beaded with a circular pendant; and the fourth and lowest a thick chain with a large oval pendant (with a representation of an oval stone in the center and small stones along the perimeter) with four suspended chains with drops on the ends, of the same type as worn at the center of the head ornament. She wears a thick spiral bracelet with studded decoration on each wrist, and a ring with a circular jeweled bezel on the little finger of her left hand. The left hand is poorly executed, while more attention is paid to the right with the fingernails represented.
The face is rectangular with broad planes for cheeks. The hair is drawn back and up in individual wavy locks. The broadly arching eyebrows are incised; the almond-shaped eyes are prominent with thickened upper lids overlapping the lower; protruding irises incised around the perimeter and with dark pigment. The nose is long and straight with deeply incised nostrils; an indentation separates the nose from the small mouth; finely shaped lips with gouges at the outer corners. Top of head is roughly finished. Inscription to viewer's right of head is false and was probably added in the 19th c.

Fowlkes-Childs & Seymour: ""A small group of relief plaques from Palmyra feature crouching felines and seated humped bulls (zebu) inside frames of beading and leaf-and-dart ornament. Their significance and original contexts were probably religious, although none have secure findspots. The spotted feline on this relief is most likely a cheetah, since its claws appear to be nonretractable; a hunting leopard is another possibility. Alert and snarling, with sharp teeth visible in its open mouth, the animal is in profile facing left with straps looping around its neck, through a ring, and under its belly. Some traces of black pigment appear in the incised circles that form the spots. Red pigment remains on one of the straps as well as on part of the fame. The ring and straps could indicate simply that the cheetah, popular as hunting game, is in captivity. Alternatively, the straps could suggest that the animal represents the harnessed mount for a Palmyrene divinity: a relief dedicated to the god Malku shows a deity in a chariot drawn by spotted felines, and the god Malakbel is depicted in a chariot drawn by griffins.""",35 cm,Leopard | Floral Motif,,,,,Limestone | Pigment,,B8907,,CBS8907 - Other Number | P263724 - CDLI Number,,,Syria | Palmyra,Near Eastern,,,,,40 cm

PBS XIV: A mythological scene in two registers, above the celestial court and below the birdman brought in judgment.
The upper register shows an assembly of three or four seated gods, attended by three worshipers or divine attendants. All wear the horned mitre (?) and the flounced Sumerian skirt. The first god, facing toward the right, has another figure, perhaps a goddess seated in his lap. This group closely resembles a rare composition of Etana carried to heaven by the eagle. The second god is perhaps Shamash with the flaming wings. The third is probably Ea holding to his breast the spouting vase. The last seated god is very indistinct.
In the lower register a seated god very indistinct is approached by a procession of figures among which are two birdmen. The leader has a flounced Sumerian skirt, a club on his shoulder and perhaps a short stick in the other hand. The two birdmen are not bound like prisoners, but carry two weapons, one on each shoulder, a round headed club, and a stick. The first with head turned back seems to master or lead the second. The three last figures are carriers dressed and armed like the leader. Hanging from crooked sticks over their shoulders are first a net with fruits or some provisions, next a bunch of dates and a small bird – a birdman (?) – last an indistinct object, all of which seem to be symbols of a fruitful vegetation, and protection against damages done by the winged enemies.
This archaic composition , although incomplete and defaced, is rich in details. Seal impress. on a fragment of clay bulla with marks of strings at the back. Nippur, 1889.

The scene has only two figures without any divine attendant or accessories. The seated king holds in his extended hand a small two handled vase, a symbol of prayers and perfumes or precious offerings. He has a turban, with locks of hair on the forehead and the neck, no beard, large set eyes, high cheek bones, a curved nose, thin lips and a firm and round chin, of the Sumerian type of Gudea. He wears a necklace and bracelets and a flounced robe covering one shoulder. His seat is covered with three rows of flounced material, with a cross bar between the legs, and rests on a dais.
A bareheaded worshiper, shaven and shorn and wearing a fringed shawl, stands in front with clasped hands. He is probably the owner of the seal, the high priest of Enlil at Nippur, to whom the seal was given by Ibi-Sin.
“Ibi-sin//the mighty king//the king of Ur//the king of the four regions of the world//to Sag-Nannarzu//priest of Enlil//his servant//has given as a present”
The seal impressions are on a clay bulla with marks of strings on the back. The sealing secured the binding of a packet. The name of the addressee in cuneiform characters has been added with the stylus:
“Ur-Shulpae, banker//son of Erindan”

It was excavated in the area of the sacred enclosure of the temple of the god Ptah at Memphis, Egypt. The sphinx, a lion with a human head, represents the power of the Egyptian king, both to protect his people and to conquer the enemies of Egypt. This statue was buried up to its shoulders; only the exposed head was attacked by windblown sand, which eroded the facial features and the royal false beard. The inscriptions on the chest and around the base give the five names of Ramses II. His son and successor, Merenptah, added his own cartouches to the shoulders after his father's death. This sphinx, the the largest in the Western hemisphere, was quarried at Aswan and transported by river to the Ptah Temple at Memphis, 600 miles away. While it has never been placed on a scale, it is estimated to weigh just under 13 tons.",,Sphinx,,362 cm,Sacred enclosure of the temple of the god Ptah,,Granite,,E12326,,,,New Kingdom | Nineteenth Dynasty,Egypt | Memphis (Egypt),Egyptian,,,,,145 cm

Between the pendants are flat rectangular strips. At each end is a pair of acorns with a hook at one end and a loop at the other.
The necklace is composed of fourteen hollow, half round, backed pendants of two types. 1) with fluted bottom and 2) with plain bottom. They have a female face surmounted by a rosette on top of either a fluted or plain bottom with a globe at its apex. Type 1 rosettes have a granulated center and 8 rays. They all seem to have been beaten into a mold and then backed. As presently strung, between each pendant is a group of spacers in two rows. the top row has a single flat sheet of gold beaten over a mold to simulate granulation (squares in parallel rows), with its edges bent over to form two stringing tubes. The bottom row consists of two pieces similar to those described above flanking a third which supports a fourth (these two are connected by interlocking tubes). This bottom bead supports a flat, beaten, backless pendant of which there are three types; seven hemispherical discs, four grape clusters, and one palmette. The clasps are in the form of two acrons, one with a hook, the other with a loop. The loop is made of thick plain wire ornamented with a line of beaded wire and is joined to the acorns by two S curves. The curves are ornamented by a large coarse granule surrounded by granulated wire on each of the four tight curves. The hook has a granulated wire running down the center and has a few coarse granules at the tip. This form of gold leaf necklace is quite common in late antiquity and was made to be buried since it is quite attractive, but of low cost.",2.5 cm,,,29 cm,,,Gold,,MS4021,,,,Hellenistic Period,Mediterranean,Mediterranean,,,,,
